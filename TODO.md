- audio transcoding
- re-order audio and subtitle tracks if they exist
- make sure metadata is copied over
- calculate VMAF and PSNR values
- loop transcode over several options
- create chunked small sample videos from input for testing - detect scene changes maybe
- make AI do all the work for me
